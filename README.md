Program designed to determine the statistical significance, if any, between a control, expermental, and placebo group using a double blind method.

Asks for the names of three files, takes each file and creates a count for the number of entries, sums all the entries, averages the entries, gets the sum of the squares, calculates the standard deviation, and compares each group against the other to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between each group.

Then asks for the user to select a name for a file to be created to store the results, creates the file, and stores the results:

Statistics:

group 1: average = 69.00, standard deviation = 18.42

group 2: average = 47.00, standard deviation = 19.92

group 3: average = 51.58, standard deviation = 19.20

Results:

<data file 1 name> vs. <data file 2 name> : (true/false)

<data file 1 name> vs. <data file 3 name> : (true/false)

<data file 2 name> vs. <data file 3 name> : (true/false)
